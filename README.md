## Recycler View Demo

This is the code discussed during week 2 of the Codepath Android class (Sep 2017). This roughly follows the guide at [https://guides.codepath.com/android/using-the-recyclerview](https://guides.codepath.com/android/using-the-recyclerview).

In addition to a basic recycler view demo, we also cover: 

- Toolbar vs ActionBar
- Intents as a way to navigate between activities.
